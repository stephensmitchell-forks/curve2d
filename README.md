# Curve2D

A 2D curve system that computes intersections.

NOTE: The API is still very much in flux.

## Supported Curves

  - Conics
    - Infinite lines
    - Circles
    - Ellipses
    - Generalized conics

### Future Support

  - Bernstein Polynomials
  - Splines
    - Bezier curves
    - B-splines

## Notes

  - Curve2D uses a `_Math` object that can be polyfilled if necessary. This object is exposed through the API.

## Usage

Unit tests contain executable documentation on how each function should be used.
